BAD;" Ethereum's co-founder Gavin Wood said cryptocurrency investors need to be more aware of what is backing their holdings after a market rout which wiped more than $800 billion off their value.

""I would hope that people pay more attention to what is belying the currency name when they get involved in a community, ecosystem, economy,"" Wood told Reuters on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in the Swiss Alpine resort of Davos.

Crypto and blockchain firms have been highly visible at this year's gathering of business and political leaders, despite the market plummeting in value in the weeks leading up to the event, with the eighth-largest coin Luna becoming virtually worthless.

British computer scientist Wood was attending for the first time to talk about a new partnership between his blockchain project Polkadot with American billionaire Frank McCourt's Project Liberty.

Blockchains are public ledgers that keep records of transactions on networks of computers, and, along with cryptocurrencies, are largely unregulated.

""The internet has no real concept of legality, because legality is something that is determined by sovereign nations,"" Wood said in an interview.

The new partnership is aimed at decentralizing control of the web and giving users more control of their data, Wood said.

""The technology cannot prevent people from making mistakes but can help those who want to understand better the facts of the world, what they're buying,"" said Wood."

That set the bar pretty high if 2022 was going to beat it. In the first quarter of 2022, capital inflows from venture capitalists were over $14.6 billion, or around 48% of all the capital investment by the last year.
NEUTRAL;"Since 2015, the bill has been debated in the Chamber of Deputies. After passing several rounds, including the Senate’s Economics Committee, Senator Irajá said that the National Congress will pass the bill by the end of 2022. Both Chamber of Deputies and President Jair Bolsonaro need to sign the bill.

The passed law will empower the Brazilian president to establish a federal entity to carry out all of the country’s legal cryptocurrency laws.

If no new regulator gets appointed, the region’s Securities and Exchange Commission or the Central Bank of Brazil will most likely assume responsibilities. Furthermore, crypto miners would not have to pay any tax on the importation of the Australian Securities & Investments Commission (ASIC) mining equipment.

The law would ensure that the government has sufficient authority to regulate cryptocurrency in order to prevent it from being used for illegal activities or money laundering.

Those who misuse cryptocurrency will face serious consequences, including a prison sentence of at least four to eight years. The bill also states that specific exemptions and incentives will be granted to entice miners to relocate to the country."

NEUTRAL;"As France braces for the April 24 presidential election in a runoff, political pundits around the globe are making their bets. The choice is between the centrist incumbent Emmanuel Macron and right-wing populist Marine Le Pen. Much of the political debate this time revolves around economics, but there is one indispensable part of it that is largely absent from the candidates’ electoral agendas: digital assets. While both have a record of public statements on matters related to crypto, neither Macron nor Le Pen seems to be likely to trigger any significant policy change with regard to the French digital economy.

Despite the current administration’s notable efforts to embrace the IT industry, France is still, in many ways, not a particularly tech-friendly country. For years, its authorities have been fighting in the avant-garde of the European regulatory cause against United States tech behemoths’ tax “optimization” practices, such as opening European offices in more relaxed jurisdictions such as Ireland and Luxembourg."
BAD;"f the proposed legislation passes, proof-of-work mining of Bitcoin and Ethereum (PoW) would be prohibited.

The proposed bill is being widely opposed by miners and crypto enthusiasts in that state. One of the BTC support associations that has reacted most strongly has been the Bitcoin Advocacy Group, which has asked the New York crypto community to oppose this legal proposal."

BAD;"Metaverse skeptics fear the prospect of unprotected data and large-scale user surveillance on a scale never seen before. Ironically, the largest company pushing the Metaverse, Meta (previously known as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB)), has faced its own fair share of privacy scandals in the internet’s current iteration, culminating in Mark Zuckerberg being infamously hauled before the United States Congress to answer for Facebook's inability to combat hate speech and data privacy violations.

NEUTRAL;"The cryptocurrency market is known for its high volatility and the wild-west nature of the space is, in part, due to many of the assets having small market caps and the 24/7 operational hours of centralized and decentralized exchanges (DEXs).

In this week’s newsletter, we will also look at derivative exchange dYdX’s plans to go fully decentralized by the end of the year. The price momentum of the DeFi tokens remained neutral, with several tokens registering a bullish surge. However, the market volatility meant many of them couldn’t hold onto those gains."
NEUTRAL;"he concept of lending and borrowing is as old as time itself. Regarding finances, while some individuals have more than enough for themselves, others barely have enough to get by. As long as there is this imbalance in finance distribution, there will always be a need to borrow and a desire to lend.

Lending involves giving out a resource on credit with the condition of it being returned upon an agreed period of time. In this case, such resources would be money or any financial asset."
NEUTRAL;"Since the wake of the nonfungible token (NFT) boom, creators have been leaving their Web2 entities in droves and are carving their own lanes in the Web3 world.

It’s not just technologists and artsy-creators who are pivoting toward Web3. For example, former American professional baseball player Micah Johnson pivoted to painting and focused his pieces on representation. In debuting his first digital piece, sä-v(?-)r?n-t? (pronounced “sovereignty') Johnson was not only fueled by adversity but inspired by a question that would change the trajectory of his work."
NEUTRAL;"Blue-chip NFTs is a popular buzzword one will find strewn across Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) and various crypto media. The term, “blue chip,” is borrowed from traditional finance where stocks that are considered to be the well-established extension of corporations known for their quality, reliability and financial stability. But, exactly what are blue chip NFTs and how are they identified?

Nansen research analyst Louisa Choe, comments to Cointelegraph that since NFTs are still nascent “...it is sometimes challenging to apply this criteria since NFT as an asset class is still evolving.” The general consensus is that the much sought after blue chip is the asset with the least amount of volatility, meaning it sustains its value over time."
GOOD;"The concept of nonfungible tokens (NFT) came into existence in 2015, and it first got some traction in 2017 when many prominent digital collectibles such as CryptoPunks and EtherRock were created.

NFTs got early traction among premier sports clubs but burst into mainstream popularity after digital artist Beeple’s artwork was sold as an NFT for over $69 million. The Beeple event caught the attention of the world and proved to be a breakout movement for the NFT ecosystem."
NEUTRAL;"Loans based on cryptocurrencies have become a mainstay of the decentralized finance (DeFi) universe ever since the smart contract-based lending/borrowing platforms began offering the service to crypto users. The Ethereum network, the first blockchain that scaled the smart contract functionality, sees most of the total value locked (TVL) on DeFi protocols dominated by cryptocurrency lending platforms.

According to data from DeFi Pulse, the top 4 of 10 DeFi protocols are lending protocols that account for $37.04 billion in TVL, just 49% of TVL of the entire DeFi market on the Ethereum blockchain. Ethereum leads in terms of being the most utilized blockchain for the DeFi market and the TVL on the network.

NEUTRAL;"As the 2021-2022 United Kingdom tax year finished on April 5, 2022, Her Majesty's Treasury announced they were paving the way for the U.K. to become a global crypto asset technology hub. This could mean that the previously not particularly crypto-friendly U.K. is changing its strategy and trying its hand at making crypto investments more attractive. But what are the potential scenarios at play?

The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), a financial regulatory body in the U.K., in its “Cryptoasset consumer research 2021” report, shows that approximately 2.3. million adult U.K. citizens held crypto in 2021, a 21% rise year-over-year. It seems natural that with rising interest and potential crypto mass adoption, HM Treasury would revisit its crypto regulations. This is especially true when considering that more and more private investment within the U.K. is located in crypto assets: Out of the 17.3 million adults who own some sort of investment product, 2.3 million are invested in crypto (according to the FCA’s “Financial Lives” survey)."
GOOD;"The acceptance of cryptocurrencies in many countries keeps growing as days go by. Aside from El Salvador, the country of Argentina is also known for its people’s support of crypto assets and its blockchain. The decentralized feature of crypto is one of the reasons why the Argentinian community loves digital assets. It is also their way of getting free from the highly controlled currency of the Argentinian peso, according to various media sources. One of the characteristics of crypto assets that attract the citizens of Argentina is its ability to shield itself from inflation. It is no surprise that inflation is high in the country, and people are looking for ways to survive the high cost of living, which rises every year. Furthermore, Bitcoin and other crypto assets feature a mining mechanism where miners can earn crypto in the comfort of their homes, which is very helpful during the pandemic.

These things mentioned above are just some benefits that cryptocurrency can provide. In detail, the space also has DeFi, which lets its users earn while simply staking their tokens. In addition, users can immerse themselves in the NFT and metaverse space, technologies of the industry that are very hot topics today.

Regardless, the crypto-verse is also prone to volatility and wild market swings. It can also be abused if not managed well. Hence, it is up to the investors how they will handle their crypto assets. At the time of writing, the whole crypto market capitalization amounts to almost $2 trillion, with Bitcoin being the number one crypto that trades more than $40k per token."

In the meantime, crypto investors from China suffered a visibly lower growth rate of 194%, from $1.7 billion in 2020 to $5.1 billion in 2021. According to Chianlysis, this is a slower growth rate compared to other countries.

With all these supporters that Coinbase possesses, it can be expected that the marketplace can also earn more fans and investors.

Moreover, the achievement of the Coinbase marketplace is also the success of the 0x network. As a result, ZRX might be facing mass adoption anytime soon. Hence, 0x price skyrocketing to over 100x may happen anytime within this year. But of course, this bullish forecast for ZRX will still depend on the performance and behavior of its investors and supporters in the network."

BAD;"In a statement published by former video-game giant Atari on Monday, the firm says it has, effective immediately, terminated all license agreements with its joint venture partner ICICB Group and its subsidiaries. Previously, the two had jointly created the Atari Chain and the namesake Atari Token (ATRI).

GOOD;"In preparation for the much-anticipated Ethereum transition from proof-of-work into Proof-of-Stake (PoS), dubbed the merge, developers have successfully activated PoS on the Ropsten test network.

Ropsten Now Running Proof-of-Stake

On Wednesday, June 8, Ropsten began running the proof-of-stake algorithm after the codes of its PoW chain were merged with the codes of the PoS beacon chain.

The Ropsten merge serves as a practice session for the mainnet merge. Client software teams are now checking using Ethereum nodes (on Ropsten) to see if it performs without any glitches.

Client software teams participated in the merge, including Lighthouse, Lodestar, Prysm, Teku, Besu, Erigon, go-ethereum (geth) and Nethermind.

PoS is Around the Corner for Ethereum

The successful merge on Ropsten prepares the way for the Ethereum mainnet merge scheduled to happen later this year.

However, other merges on Goerli and Seoplia testnets are expected to happen in the coming months before we can finally see the PoS on the Ethereum mainnet.

The transition from PoW to PoS will end ETH mining, giving rewards to stakers instead. It will also reduce Ethereum’s energy consumption by 99.95%."
GOOD;"Historically, we have seen Cardano’s (ADA) price explode into a bullish rally during hard fork events. With the Vasil Hard Fork around the corner, ADA may be gearing up for a 30% move.

As things stand, Cardano (ADA) is number 6 on CoinMarketCap’s list of the biggest crypto projects, with a market cap of $22.05 billion. This ranks ADA below Binance Coin (BNB), with a market cap of $47.18 billion, and above Ripple (XRP), with a market cap of $19.38 billion.

Looking at the 24-hour performance, ADA is up by 1.85% in the last 24 hours. This takes its price to $0.6511. ADA’s price is also up in the past seven days by 13.37%. This makes it the only coin that has posted double-digit gains in the last week on CoinMarketCap’s top 10 list.

The main reason for Cardano’s weekly price performance is the build-up to the next major hard fork event, called the Vasil Hard Fork. Historically, hard fork events have seen the price of ADA pump, and it looks like this time will be no different."

The user, Straight-Hat3855, brought attention to a “serious problem” with Osmosis (OSMO) that allowed users to arbitrarily grow LPs by 50% simply by adding and removing liquidity. The Reddit post was quickly removed, but not before malicious actors took advantage of the bug, which saw approximately $5 million removed from liquidity pools on the Osmosis exchange."

BAD;"Shiba Inu (SHIB) is facing a variety of threats at the moment. One of these threats is the fact that the SHIB burn rate has dropped by 75% overnight. This comes after the SHIB burn was doing pretty well at the beginning of the week.

About 34.72 SHIB tokens were burned over the last 24 hours. At the moment, around 41% of SHIB’s circulating supply has already been burned. The fact that SHIB’s burn rate is decreasing is a problem as many believe it is a key driver of bullish sentiment in the ShibArmy.

Another threat for SHIB is the fact that its exchange reserves have plummeted. Investors have amassed around 1.02 trillion SHIB, which is worth about $10.6 million. These tokens have all been pulled out of SHIB’s circulating supply.

If SHIB were to see a trend reversal, there is a possibility that over $1 trillion SHIB coins will hit exchanges. This will then increase the selling pressure which will then lead to a drop in price."
BAD;"The Dogecoin (DOGE) price is still in chaos after the bulls have lost support of the $0.08 level. The DOGE price is also set to drop even further after bears breached a triangular structure that positioned itself on DOGE throughout May.

DOGE/USDT 1-day chart (Source: FXStreet)

Now that this structure has been breached, bears will more than likely start injecting some capital into their short positions to make a profit from the impending decline in price. Another damning aspect to consider is that the bearish engulfing candle that breached the structure is moving in a free-fall fashion.

At the moment, DOGE is worth $0.07625. It is still possible for a short pause to occur before reaching the next target at $0.072. Unfortunately, it seems like the bears are very unlikely to drop their hold on the meme coin until after the liquidity under the May 12th lows at $0.068 is taken out.

Another bearish factor to acknowledge is that DOGE was rejected on the Relative Strength Index 40 level."
BAD;"According to the crypto market tracker, CoinMarketCap, the price of Polkadot (DOT) has declined over the last 24 hours.

At the time of writing, the price of Polkadot is around $8.84, which is 4.08% lower than it was yesterday. The 24-hour price movement has also added to DOT’s slump in price over the last seven days as the coin finds its price down by almost 6%. Now, a descending triangle has formed on the weekly chart for DOT/USDT, which dips below the key price level on the weekly chart of $10. The price of DOT does seem to be attempting to break out of the bearish triangle chart pattern but will still have a massive hurdle of challenging the $10 level with the next weekly candle."
NEUTRAL;"Blake West, a former senior engineer at Coinbase, shares tips he believes may put the decentralized financial (DeFi) industry at a better competitive edge against the traditional financial economies.

He did this via a 12-paragraph Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) thread on June 9, 2022, in which he started by posing a question: “Want DeFi to grow 100x from here? The answer is to be boring!”

Firstly, he compared the revenue of the markets. According to him, the global e-commerce companies made $2.2 trillion in revenue last year, while the non-fungible token (NFT) revenue from creators was only $3.9 billion.

West argues that speculative activities in crypto, NFTs, gaming, or web3 social are great but would do the DeFi industry less good. He believes the DeFi industry needs to move away from speculations and into the boring everyday financial activities of the legacy industries. According to Binance Academy, DeFi is the use of decentralized networks and open-source software to create financial services and products. The functions of DeFi include creating monetary banking services like the issuance of stablecoins, providing peer-to-peer or pooled lending and borrowing platforms, and enabling advanced financial instruments such as DEX, tokenization platforms, derivatives, etc."

Crypto analysts predict that the price of Shiba Inu crypto will rise this year. According to the market, the cost of Shiba Inu is expected to increase even more in the future.

The coin has been shown to be far more than a joke coin, with its use as a payment channel particularly noteworthy. Its ShibaSwap trade continues to increase in popularity.

The exchange’s total worth has declined dramatically from its highs in July 2021, but it still has enough to continue on an organic development path."
GOOD;"This week, Cardano has seen unprecedented success. At the time of writing, the token’s value has climbed by 20.45 percent in just seven days. The sharp climb is projected to continue through June, with experts predicting a 52 percent increase.

Cardano is also gaining traction among well-known musicians. Soulja Boy is the most recent. He is a famous rapper who recently tweeted about his interest in Cardano NFTs. This appears to have the potential to increase the popularity of Cardano NFTs among his devoted followers, hence increasing the value of the Cardano token.

Since the debut of Lagon’s cross-chain bridge, the Cardano price has risen with increased activity in the Cardano DeFi ecosystem. Cardano now has smart-contract capabilities, allowing it to create 94 blockchain applications. It is growing in terms of its value and the technologies and services it provides."
GOOD;"Gnox is a rapidly expanding DeFi platform that offers a unique “yield farming as a service” service. Its foundation is the Binance Smart Chain, which will also support Polygon and Ethereum. The platform’s creators claim that it is infinitely scalable.

Gnox is an excellent option for beginners who want to engage in DeFi opportunities but do not have the time to conduct the necessary research.

Short-term speculation is discouraged by Gnox, which imposes a 10% “tax” on each transaction. To begin with, 6% of this fund is gathered into a treasury, which is then invested across various DeFi platforms. The rewards are shared with every Gnox holder on a monthly basis.

The project has previously passed the KYC Defi’s verification analysis. The platform will be officially launched on July 18t.

Conclusion

All three of these tokens are performing exceedingly well this year. While all three are predicted to explode this year, analysts say people are more focused on the Gnox Token. Gnox leads the Defi sector by paving the way for the next generation of reflection tokens.

NEUTRAL;"In modern times of rapid globalization and digitization, technological developments have now reached such proportions that the usage of cryptocurrencies is no new phenomenon. The technology behind blockchain opens the internet for financial services by replacing trust, a fundamental component of the financial system for centuries, with transparency integrated into a decentralized network. Thereby, blockchain bears the potential to help achieve the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) by empowering the unbanked, predominantly women, reducing transaction fees as well as creating an alternative source of liquidity.

Only 57.7% of adults in Ghana in 2021 had a bank account. Unable to afford participation in the formal financial system, the poor find themselves paying the most for fundamental financial services. Moreover, there is a multiplier effect inherent with the economic participation of women that takes wide-ranging consequences respecting a number of SDGs."
NEUTRAL;"The funny thing about many of the absolutely insane things happening in the world today is that from a certain perspective, they actually make perfect sense. Take the famous brands buying metaverse real estate, for example. At first glance, it makes no sense at all. At second glance, assuming the user base of the respective projects grows over time, it’s like buying an ad banner on a website, just at a higher markup. Considering how many headlines you get on the purchase, the purchase becomes quite sensible even if you do nothing with your plot of virtual land.

It’s quite possible to make the same case for nonfungible token (NFT) art, another major trend in the blockchain space, at least in how much buzz it has generated. Just a few months ago, Paris Hilton and Jimmy Fallon checked how deep the cringe abyss goes on live TV as they showcased their Bored Apes. And that’s just a few of the mainstream celebs who have joined the NFT art hype train recently, with quite a few of them managed by the same entity, United Talent Agency.

Now, the Fed is going in the opposite direction in order to combat inflation. In addition to raising interest rates, the central bank has begun the process of quantitative tightening (QT).

NEUTRAL;"Stablecoins are a controversial subject in crypto. Questioning the legitimacy and backing of Tether (USDT) is a right of passage for many entering the crypto market for the first time. The meltdown of the Terra (LUNC; or the old LUNA) ecosystem left little doubt that algorithmic stablecoins don’t have a future beyond Do Kwon’s fantasies. Pesky regulators are constantly poking and prodding at dollar-pegged assets to carve out firmer rules on their usage.

But, if you look beyond all the fear, uncertainty and doubt, stablecoins are providing liquidity to millions of people who don’t have access to dollars because of capital controls or sanctions, or because hyperinflation is destroying their local currency.

As crypto-assets become an integral part of Canada’s financial system, the inherent chance of vulnerabilities also surges since most people have low financial literacy, which could end up impacting the broader financial system. While speaking in an interview, Rogers stated: “This (digital assets) is an area that is still small, but it’s growing really rapidly. And it is largely unregulated. We don’t want to wait until it gets a lot larger before we bring regulatory controls in place.”

She further mentioned that people see cryptocurrency as an opportunity for quick money, without realizing the volatility or even the unregulated nature of the market. To substantiate her argument she cited the recent market crash that soured the high-risk assets’ appetite, causing significant financial losses to many investors globally.

Roger believes that the industry needs to be regulated, however, the challenge is to find out an appropriate way of doing it. Speaking of which, she opined:"

According to the rules of Bored Apes Yacht Club, every NFT owner can use the owned apes for commercial purposes. However, a dodgy link led Seth Green to a malicious NFT minting website and his digital belongings were quickly exposed.

Since OpenSea still has a flag on the particular NFT for ‘suspicious activity’, a repurchase of the Bored Ape #8398 on the marketplace is impossible. However, Seth Green managed to get in touch with DarkWing84 and transferred another 165.005 of Ethereum (ETH) in order to get the beloved Bored Ape NFT back via escrow. The Ethereum spent on the recovery of this NFT equals $286,649,99. In contrast, that’s about $100,000 over the top if compared to what DarkWing84 spent to acquire the stolen NFT."

TRON is also attempting to break the resistance barrier on the higher time frame in order to flip it into a support floor. If this move is executed successfully, the bulls will have an opportunity to rally.

For over a month, TRON has been looking to flip the $0.0815 resistance barrier into a support level. The first sign that TRON is ready to move higher will be when buyers step in and the daily candlesticks close above the resistance.

Notably, investors should keep in mind that they need to wait for a retest to confirm the flip into a support level. This will create a chance for TRON to visit the next resistance at $0.101.

Data reveals that even though China’s consumer price index (CPI) slightly hiked last month, the factory gate inflation fell for the seventh month consecutively. The CPI increased by 2.1% in May.

While the Chinese government experienced a fall in CPI, nine hours later, the US government announced that it was expecting its CPI to rise by 5.9% year on year.

Economists estimate the consumer price index to rise by 0.7% in May, up from 0.3% in April, according to Dow Jones. On a year-over-year basis, that works out to 8.3 percent, the same percentage as in April. The CPI data will be released on Friday.

While several projects were eventually exposed as scams, newcomer Gnox Token stood out because of its strong advocacy for its holders and impressive community.

Currently in its pre-sale period, Gnox’s price has risen by 52 percent thanks to its strong passive income utility resulting in more investors showing interest in the project.

Gnox is unusual in that it provides a single investment vehicle that bypasses the technical hurdles in the DeFi world.

Many crypto investors cannot take advantage of DeFi’s highest yield chances, and Gnox is the first protocol to create a custom treasury that will introduce all of its token holders to DeFi’s revenue opportunities.

The treasury’s earnings will be reflected in stablecoin for token owners, and the treasury will be supported by purchase and sell taxes.

It may even be common knowledge that during bull cycles, investors are sure of making gains. Whereas in bear markets such as this, an unimaginable amount of pessimism sets in.

NEUTRAL;"Often dubbed as the “Ethereum killer”, Cardano is a blockchain network with a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism that makes it much faster, cheaper, and energy-efficient than a proof-of-work concept like Ethereum. The native token ADA enables holders to vote on governance proposals, and the voting rights can also be delegated in exchange for rewards. The recent Alonzo upgrade in late 2021 facilitated the implementation of full smart-contract functionality on the blockchain.

With 72% of the total supply staked with validators, Cardano has billions of dollars stored in safe wallets. If the total stake is counted, Cardano’s TVL would be over $19 billion at its current valuation, which is hovering around 55 cents at the time of writing. When the tables turn and the bull run resumes, ADA will be one of the first cryptos to go on a parabolic rise at the back of its strong fundamentals.

Gnox (GNOX)

The need for simplification and innovation in the DeFi space gave birth to a community-focused ecosystem, Gnox. It is a decentralized protocol that offers “Yield farming as a service” to its native token holders. Unlike other reflection projects, it leverages a treasury of its own to reap rewards from various DeFi protocols. Based on the size of the holdings, stable coins are redistributed to every GNOX holder in proportion to what the treasury makes. In addition to that, a 1% tax on each transaction is directly credited to the eligible wallet. Basically, a user can earn passive income by just purchasing and holding GNOX.

The project is currently in the presale phase with multichain expansion and an aggregator tool in the making. A comprehensive audit by Soken has further strengthened the trust in the project. Crypto enthusiasts are looking to get in early before the price explodes, following the contract launch in July."

After Celsius's announcement, bitcoin touched an 18-month low of $23,300. No.2 token ether dropped as much as 18% to $1,176, its lowest since January 2021.

Crypto markets have dived in the past few weeks as rising interest rates and surging inflation prompted investors to ditch riskier assets across financial markets.

On its first quarter conference call, the company was asked how far does Bitcoin need to fall for Microstrategy to receive a margin call.

CFO Phong Le indicated that it would have to fall to around $21,000 to trigger a margin call, or 50% LTV.

Le also said before it gets to 50%, they could contribute more Bitcoin to the collateral package.

""As far as where Bitcoin needs to fall, we took out the loan at a 25% LTV, the margin call occurs 50% LTV,"" Le said. ""So essentially, Bitcoin needs to cut in half or around $21,000 before we'd have a margin call. That said, before it gets to 50%, we could contribute more Bitcoin to the collateral package, so it never gets there, so we don't ever get into a situation of March call also.""

Le said the loan wasn't taken for cash-flow purposes, saying they took out the loan primarily so that they could continue to invest more in Bitcoin and also to create a market for a Bitcoin-backed term loan."

The lawsuit claims that the exchange played its part in misleading the investors about LUNA. Over 2,000 investors who lost their life savings claim that false marketing is the primary reason for losing funds.

Binance.US has been indicted for misleading investors over the Terra blockchain ecosystem in a class action complaint filed on Monday in North California.

The suit held witness to the first US court filing associated with LUNA, Terra, and the entire Do Kwon ecosystem. LUNA wiped out over $40 billion in funds of investors who witnessed the coin falling to zero.

Terra’s fall has been hurtful to small and retail investors like Hashed and Paradigm. Terra’s fall also witnessed a lot of people taking their lives as they lost their life savings in the catastrophic fall. The lawsuit filed by Roche Freedman law firm states that Binance marketed UST as more stable than it was.

Thousands of naïve retail investors were caught off guard when UST and its sister token Luna classic (LUNC) collapsed to zero in May. The suit claims that misleading advertising is to blame for the losses.

Additionally, the lawsuit is also alleging that Binance.US is not registered as an exchange or a broker. According to the lawsuit, this holds a charge for violating securities law. The lawsuit is a different turn in Terra’s case, where the listed exchange is charged instead of the organization that launched the coin."

GOOD;"Chronoly.io has gained a significant amount of attention in the last couple of weeks from many in the crypto space. The project comes to solve a big trust issue by giving buyers the possibility to invest in fractions of high-end rare, luxury, and exclusive watches like Rolex or Patek Philippe. Each watch is authenticated, stored in a highly secured vault, then minted as an NFT which is broken down into many fractions thus allowing anyone to invest from as little as $1 in a highly appreciative asset. Furthermore, if an investor places a buyout offer for 100% of the NFT fractions they can take physical delivery by a highly secured logistics partner who will ship to over 130 destinations worldwide.

In today’s unpredictable crypto market, investors are also looking for value-based companies to invest in. Chronoly (CRNO) investors can rest easy knowing the value of their investment will rise regardless of market conditions as collectible timepieces continue to appreciate. Being a world’s first unique concept the opportunity to still purchase during presale is worth grabbing with both hands."

BAD;"Advertising security firm Confiant announced its discovery of a new hacking scheme within the crypto space. This time, hackers are tricking people into giving away their seed phrase through fake crypto wallets.

According to Confiant, hackers have been cloning the wallet interface of reputable applications like MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, TokenPocket, and imToken. Unsuspecting users would then download these cloned wallets and key in their seed phrase. Once the seed phrase has been submitted, hackers would obtain the information and drain the victim’s account of his or her crypto.

This new scheme has been identified as “Seaflower,” and regular users would find it difficult to detect this malicious attack. In detail, these cloned apps are identical to the legitimate ones, although they have a different codebase that allows hackers to obtain the seed phrases."
GOOD;"In the face of the growing number of scams plaguing the NFT industry, NFT marketplace OpenSea has launched a new feature to prevent future NFT scams, fraud, and hacks on its platform.

According to a Monday blog post, the new feature will automatically conceal suspicious NFT transactions from the general market.

The leading NFT marketplace recently came under fire for the rate at which non-fungible tokens (NFTs) were stolen and plagiarized on the platform. It believes that the new feature will help protect users from being scammed and ensure that only legitimate transactions are visible.

A recent blogby the project’s co-founder and CEO Derin Finzer revealed that the firm plans to make substantial investments in some key areas, including theft prevention, IP infringement, scaling review and moderation, and reducing critical response times in high-touch settings.

The firm also set up a special moderation team to handle review and moderation. In addition, OpenSea intends to use ""critical auto-detection"" technologies to tackle copyright concerns and other fraud vectors henceforth.

Finzer insists that the overall performance of the platform will be improved if they succeed in fixing these types of issues in the system. It will help prevent unsolicited advertisements and bogus offers that may be found on open blockchains from being seen on OpenSea."

Among many perks, the protocol says it will feature lower gas fees, the ability to make offers on entire collections, removal of new account initialization fees and more user-friendly signature options.

As told by OpenSea, users would pay 35% less for gas fees when transacting on Seaport. Based on data from 2021, it would amount to an estimated $460 million (138,000 ETH) in total savings. In addition, the removal of the setup fee would potentially result in $120 million (35,000 ETH) per year in additive savings."

BAD;On Tuesday, tokens of cloud blockchain infrastructure provider Chain.com (XCN) suddenly lost over 90% of their value before recovering most of their losses later in the day. In a post-mortem analysis published by Chain.com, the firm said that a market maker and API error at 1:00 pm SGT (5:00 am UCT) began to cause XCN to drop in large percentiles. As the event took place, corresponding bids became stuck via API orders, causing further downward selling pressure due to low liquidity and margin calls.
BAD;"Bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency by market cap, dropped below the $28,000 level in the last 24 hours. According to CoinMarketCap, the price of Bitcoin now sits around $21,290, which represents an 18.61% drop in the last 24 hours. This has also pushed the price of Bitcoin down by 28.22% over the last seven days, and its market cap to barely below $410 billion.

Likewise, the global cryptocurrency market capitalization fell below the $1 trillion cap for the first time in two years. As the market continues downwards, the global market cap is barely $917 billion from over $1.2 billion in the last 24 hours. The worst performing cryptos among the top 10 coins in the last 24 hours are Ethereum (ETH, – 18.51%), Dogecoin (DOGE, 18.44%), and Solana (SOL, – 18.23%). At the moment, DOGE lost its position among the top 10."
GOOD;"In an interesting turn of events, data available on CoinMarketCap shows that ADA, the native token of Cardano, has been holding up tightly amid the global cryptocurrency market crash.

While Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Binance Coin (BNB), and other top coins shredded above 18% of their value in the last 48 hours, ADA barely lost 10%. At the time of writing, ADA is arguably the only coin that has recovered with a 15% gain in the last 24 hours.

Interestingly, the market capitalization of ADA has climbed from $15.02 billion to $17.12 billion, adding over $2.1 billion amid the current market uncertainty. Meanwhile, the value of BTC and ETH continued to trade in the red, falling further by 7.45% and 4.23%, respectively, in the last 24 hours.

According to TradingView, ADA’s price resistance levels are $0.45 and $0.55. Likewise, it has support levels at $0.45 and $0.38. A majority of premium users on TradingView support a bullish sentiment for ADA.

In other news, Input-Output Global (IOG), a Cardano developer, lately made two product announcements via Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) that may potentially shoot up the price of ADA soon."
BAD;" The value of the cryptocurrency market on Monday fell below $1 trillion for the first time since January 2021, according to data site CoinMarketCap, reaching as low as $926 billion.

The global cryptocurrency market peaked at $2.9 trillion in November 2021, but it has faltered so far this year. It has lost $1 trillion in value in the last two months alone as investors ditched riskier assets in the face of high inflation and fears that interest rate raises by central banks will hamper growth.

The largest cryptocurrency, bitcoin, was down more than 10% on the day, falling to an 18-month low of $23,750. It is down by around 50% so far this year. Smaller coin ether fell over 15% to $1,210.

""As inflation proves to be an even trickier opponent to beat than expected, Bitcoin and Ether are continuing to get a severe bruising in the ring,"" said Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown (LON:HRGV).

""They are prime victims of the flight away from risky assets as investors fret about spiralling consumer prices around the world."""
BAD;"The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at about $20,100, down more than 2% over the past 24 hours. The decline came just two days after bitcoin cracked $21,000 as investors swooped in following a weekend dip, and amid a brief lull in the crypto calamities that have afflicted the industry in recent weeks.
Ether, the second-largest crypto by market cap, was recently changing hands at approximately $1,050, down over 5% in the past 24 hours. Other major cryptos were well into the red with troubled crypto lending platform Celsius (CEL) off by as much as over 20% and WAVES down 13%."
NEUTRAL;"Investors once again shied away from riskier assets while digesting the latest inflation remarks by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, who testified to the Senate Banking Committee that the U.S. might not avert a recession as the Fed continues its current monetary hawkishness. In separate commentaries, the CEO of Deutsche Bank and analysts from Citigroup predicted a 50% likelihood of recession. Fed critics have maintained that the bank waited too long to boost interest rates, forcing it to adopt the harsh measures that seem likely to spur economic contraction.
“It would have been better if the Fed took ‘transient’ inflation seriously earlier this year instead of downplaying it,"" Mark Lurie, CEO of crypto software provider Shipyard Software, wrote. ""But at this point, the Fed is doing the right thing by raising interest rates – inflation is public enemy #1."""
NEUTRAL;"The decentralized finance (DeFi) sector has held up well amid troubles at centralized crypto companies this month. There were hardly any massive on-chain liquidations, surprises or smart contract failures across popular DeFi apps, including Aave, Compound, Maker and others, even as crypto markets shed value.
“Established DeFi lending protocols like Aave, Compound and Maker have not had any downtime or withdrawal limitations due to excessive risk-taking of borrowers,” Alex Svanevik, founder of crypto data firm Nansen, shared in Twitter messages with CoinDesk.
“The transparency and real-time monitoring of on-chain transactions enable everyone to see liquidations and value at risk at those levels,” Svanevik added."
BAD;"Shares of Coinbase Global (COIN) fell more than 7% Wednesday, lagging crypto-exposed peers as the price of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) fell over 6% and 8%, respectively, and Binance.US said it will introduce zero-fee trading for bitcoin.
Other crypto-exposed stocks, including Galaxy Digital (GLXY) and MicroStrategy (MSTR), held up, with Galaxy adding 0.6% in Toronto, and MSTR losing 1%. Crypto miners fell. Cipher Mining (CIFR), Hive Blockchain (HIVE), Hut 8 (HUT) and Marathon Digital (MARA) all dropped at least 3%."
NEUTRAL;"There are many misconceptions about DeFi (decentralized finance). Perhaps the most important is that Defi wants to replace traditional finance. That is not the case. Rather, DeFi is a way to exponentially expand the reach of existing financial services and must be seen as a complement to TradFi, not a replacement of it.
One way to think of it is to look at the development of mobile phones into smartphones. Before the development of apps, mobile phones did one or two things – they allowed you to make and receive calls on the go and send the occasional text message. But when the app store burst into life in 2005, it was like the Cambrian explosion and a million new applications came into being. The key to that explosion was that it wasn’t dictated from on high; it was transparent, and it was open to everyone.
DeFi is transparent and permissionless, and as such, it too will evolve quickly. No one really knows how it will end up, but it is already an unstoppable trend. One of the key elements of DeFi is that it can go into areas that aren’t covered by TradFi. One is that it can create an underlying value for assets that were previously untouched by finance. It can make these assets liquid and fungible and so be used for transactions in the traditional sense, such as collateral for loans or margins for trading."
GOOD;There will be different rates of adoption of DeFi in this new era for financial services. It will naturally be better received in countries that have weak economies and poor financial infrastructure. Those poor countries have much greater incentives to find ways to increase the financial footprint of their economies. DeFi will allow them to broaden their asset base and remove the structural constraints of their existing financial systems. It is no surprise that there are already more people with MetaMask accounts in the Philippines than there are people with bank accounts.
NEUTRAL;"The only thing that DeFi removes is barriers. But it is still at a very early stage of development. And as with all new technologies at early stages of development, it can be still complicated to operate and clunky in its user experience. It is complicated for general users to start entering smart contracts and writing protocols.
“People are willing to pay for what they need,” says John Ge, founder and CEO of Matrixport. “They also lack the skills to interact with smart contracts directly – it’s too complex. If we want to get more people into DeFi, it is necessary to make it as simple as possible.”"
GOOD;Matrixport provides just such a gateway to invest directly into DeFi within several taps in its app with full transparency on yields. Its centralized-DeFi offering pools a basket of liquidity mining projects from established players such as Uniswap, Cure and Compound. The ease of the platform is built on robust research, monitoring and security audits of the underlying data protocols. This has made Matrixport’s DeFi offering popular in market neutral periods when investors are looking for stable yields.
BAD;"Bitcoin (BTC) slipped to under $20,000 during Asian trading hours on Wednesday as a brief relief rally seemed to reverse amid recession fears in the broader equity markets.
Prices dropped to just over $19,900 at press time, a 4% drop in the past 24 hours and a 7% slide over the past week. The decline came as analysts at Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs warned on Tuesday that “recession risks were “not fully priced in.""

BAD;Valuations for public crypto companies have fallen by about 70% this year, senior research analyst John Todaro told Barron’s. The sector is also in the midst of a crypto crash, which has wiped out about $2 trillion in value in the past several months. This means crypto companies are cheaper now than they were a year ago when the sector was in the midst of an upturn, Todaro said.

The total volume in DeFi stood at $5.39 billion, 8.11 percent of the total crypto market's 24-hour volume. The volume of all stable coins was $57.68 billion, 86.70 percent of the crypto market's 24-hour volume."
NEUTRAL;Meanwhile, markets are bracing for a world of higher interest rates, led by moves from the US Federal Reserve. Higher rates can bring down inflation, but they also risk bringing on a recession by slowing the economy. They also tend to hurt prices of stocks, cryptocurrencies, and other investments. Last week, the Fed hiked its key short-term interest rate by triple the usual amount in its biggest increase since 1994. It could consider another such mega hike at its next meeting in July.
NEUTRAL;"However, there is still no clarity on imposition of a sales tax on digital currencies due to ambiguity in its treatment as goods or services and a lack of a regulatory framework.

The federal government is already working on a legislation to either regulate or tighten provisions though it is expected only after a global consensus emerges on regulating such assets, Bloomberg had earlier reported."
BAD;Worries about global recessionary risks have wiped out billions in Bitcoin’s market value, with the token crashing about 70% from its peak to trade near $20,000.

NEUTRAL;"f you’re a stock trader, you should probably be turning your attention to cryptocurrencies right about now.

That’s according to Mark Mobius, who co-founded Mobius Capital Partners after spending more than three decades at Franklin Templeton Investments.

“Cryptocurrencies are a measure of investor sentiment,” he said in an interview Wednesday. “Bitcoin goes down, the next day the Dow Jones goes down. That’s the pattern you get. That shows that Bitcoin is a leading indicator.”

Only when institutional and retail investors truly “throw in the towel” and stop putting more money into the market because of losses is when sentiment has hit rock bottom, he said. “That’s the time to start buying stocks.”"
GOOD;"Wire Network has launched an interoperability protocol that gives users access to a universal, readable wallet address to send and receive non-fungible tokens as well as perform cryptocurrency swaps across any blockchain.

The Universal Polymorphic Address Protocol (UPAP) is a blockchain technology that leads a line-up of innovations focused on usability, gaming, scalability, and security for cryptocurrencies and decentralised applications (dapps).

“While other competitors have attempted interoperability, they are limited by complex procedures, vulnerable blockchain bridges… or centralised operations,” said Ken DiCross, CEO of Wire Network. “The UPAP protocol is fully decentralised… and offers low-fee service that is more secure from cyberattacks.”

DiCross said he expects every major chain, wallet and user to adopt the protocol.

NEUTRAL;"Binance U.S. and its CEO were sued on Monday by a U.S. investor who alleges the cryptocurrency exchange falsely marketed Terra USD as a safe asset ahead of the so-called stablecoin's collapse in value last month.

Stablecoins are digital tokens pegged to the value of traditional assets, such as the U.S. dollar, and are popular as safe havens in times of turmoil in crypto markets. But Terra USD's value plunged last month, breaking its 1:1 dollar peg and contributing to a tumble in other crypto assets like Bitcoin.

In the lawsuit against Binance and Chief Executive Brian Shroder, Utah resident Jeffrey Lockhart said Binance falsely advertised Terra USD as ""safe"" and backed by fiat currency, when in fact it was an unregistered security."
BAD;"Bitcoin tumbled on Monday after major U.S. cryptocurrency lending company Celsius Network froze withdrawals and transfers citing ""extreme"" conditions, in the latest sign of how financial market turbulence is causing distress in the cryptosphere.

The Celsius move triggered a slide across cryptocurrencies, with their value dropping below $1 trillion on Monday for the first time since January last year, dragged down by 11% fall in the largest token bitcoin.

After Celsius's announcement, Bitcoin touched an 18-month low of $23,476. No.2 token ether dropped as much as 16% to $1,177, its lowest since January 2021.

Crypto markets have dived in the past few weeks as rising interest rates and surging inflation hurt riskier assets across financial markets. The collapse in May of the terraUSD and luna tokens also shook the industry."

GOOD;Days after NFT trading platform OpenSea’s former executive was charged for insider trading of the digital assets, the company’s co-founder and CEO Derin Finzer has committed to step up efforts in preventing thefts, scams, and IP infringements on the marketplace. Finzer in a blog post said while plagiarism, IP infringements, and thefts are prohibited under OpenSea’s Terms, “at our scale, comprehensive policies aren’t enough”. He said the company recently launched a new verification system that identifies authentic accounts and content more prominently to keep scammers out and that OpenSea’s copy mint prevention system is the most sophisticated spam and fraud reduction tool the company has built. 
BAD;"Australians lost over AUD 113 million ($81.5m) to cryptocurrency scams between January 1 and May 1 this year, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) has announced.

According to the ACCC, including non-crypto scams, Australians lost a total of AUD 205m ($148m) this year -- a 166 percent increase, compared to the same period last year.

Actual losses much higher

ACCC has stated that actual losses in scams are likely to be much higher, as only around 13 percent of the people report their losses to Scamwatch, an ACCC-run website helping consumers and small businesses recognise, avoid and report scams.

The majority of losses over this period have been investment scams with AUD 158m ($114m) lost, an increase of 314 percent, compared to the same period last year."

The reported losses in 2021 were nearly 60 times what they were in 2018.

The top cryptocurrencies people said they used to pay scammers were Bitcoin (70 percent), Tether (10 percent), and Ether (9 percent).

According to the FTC, since the start of 2021, nearly four out of every 10 dollars reported lost to a fraud originating on social media was in crypto, far more than any other payment method."

The job was remote work and Kapur was planning on starting a new journey by moving out of India while he would continue to work for Coinbase’s India operations.

The third-largest exchange in terms of volumes, Coinbase has over 50 percent of overall crypto investors on its platform.

Kapur was set to join the US crypto exchange on June 13 when news came that the company was reconsidering its hiring plans and could also withdraw some offers that had already been extended. His first response was to check with the hiring manager he was in touch with on whether his offer still stood.

Kapur received a positive response and was told that his joining date remained unchanged. And later came a mail that said that his offer had been withdrawn.

“Their team in India was unaware of how many and which offers will be withdrawn. I shared the mail with the hiring manager after which he checked with his team. The mails were sent directly from the US team,” Kapur told Moneycontrol."
BAD;"More than 46,000 people reported losing over $1 billion in cryptocurrency scams since the start of 2021, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) said in a report on Friday.

Nearly half the people who reported losing digital currencies in a scam said it started with an ad, post or a message on a social media platform, according to the FTC. Reports point to social media and crypto as a combustible combination for fraud, the agency said, adding that about $575 million of all losses related to digital currency frauds were about ”bogus investment opportunities”.

Nearly four out of every ten dollars lost in a fraud originating on social media was lost in crypto, far more than any other payment method, with Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp and Telegram being the top social media platforms in such cases, according to the report.

The average reported loss for an individual was $2,600 and bitcoin, tether and ether were the top cryptocurrencies that people used to pay scammers, the FTC said."
NEUTRAL;"More people in the United States than ever before are turning to cryptocurrencies to help fund their retirement, it seems, even as the recent market carnage provides a stark reminder that this wild market is not for the faint-hearted.

Some 27 percent of Americans aged 18-60 - around 50 million people - have owned or traded crypto in the past six months, a poll published last week by crypto exchange KuCoin found.

Yet older folk are more devoted to the young asset class than the general population, according to the survey carried out at the end of March, with 28 percent of those aged 50 and above betting on crypto as part of their early retirement plans.

Their most popular for investing in crypto were that they saw it as the future of finance, they didn't want to miss a hot trend, and they saw it as a way to diversify their portfolios."
BAD;"European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde said crypto-currencies are “based on nothing” and should be regulated to steer people away from speculating on them with their life savings.

Lagarde told Dutch television that she’s concerned about people “who have no understanding of the risks, who will lose it all and who will be terribly disappointed, which is why I believe that that should be regulated.”

The comments come amid choppy times for crypto markets, with digital currencies Bitcoin and Ether down 50% from last year’s peak. At the same time, the asset class is facing tougher scrutiny from regulators worried about the dangers it may pose to the broader financial system.

Lagarde said she’s skeptical of crypto’s value, contrasting it with the ECB’s digital euro -- a project that may come to fruition in the next four years.

“My very humble assessment is that it is worth nothing, it is based on nothing, there is no underlying asset to act as an anchor of safety,” she said."
NEUTRAL;"With more than 100 million people globally using cryptocurrencies in 2021, the digital dollar has become a widely accepted way of saving and spending.

Even so, says a new study, a lack of knowledge of cryptos, massive fluctuations in their value and a perception that digital currencies are part of a scam have prevented more people from investing in cryptos.

Members of Gen Z, the generational cohort following the millennials and dubbed digital natives, say more government regulation and crypto law enforcement are most likely to convince them to buy cryptocurrencies, said the study by CouponFollow, a digital coupon company.

One in five people who never bought crypto has downloaded a crypto exchange app at some point, it said.

CouponFollow surveyed 1,172 respondents over the age of 18 and the respondents were limited to those in the United States who have not yet invested in cryptocurrencies."
BAD;"The sister token of stablecoin TerraUSD Luna crashed to $0 on May 13, showing a 100% erosion in its value. It was trading at an all-time high of $116 on April 5.

The market capitalization of the token slumped from around $40 billion to around $6 million during the last seven days, according to Coinmarketcap.

Luna’s downfall started when its sister token UST, which is also a stablecoin, was 'depegged' from its $1 value as big investors started dumping it.

Meanwhile, Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange, temporarily delisted UST and Luna on May 13. Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao said that while the firm “always aims to be neutral,” it “will break that rule this time.”"

The cryptocurrency has dropped 13 percent so far in May and has lost more than half its value since it hit an all-time high of $69,000 in November last year.

The chip features a 580 GH/s (gigahashes per second) hash rate, while consuming just 26 J/TH (joules per terahash), making it much more efficient. Hash rate measures how quickly a miner can generate answers to Bitcoin’s next block, while joules per terahash measure how much energy is consumed to produce every terahash.

NEUTRAL;Many physical art galleries have put on NFT exhibits in the past year. Recently, at the Non Fungible Conference in Lisbon, the NFT artist Justin Aversano announced he will open one in California.

Aversano already has experience with his NFTs showing up at physical galleries: Christie’s auctioned one of his works last October. Now the photographer will set up physical spaces to exhibit his photography NFTs—in an attempt, he says, to bridge the chasm between meatspace and metaverse.

NEUTRAL;"Currency in circulation formed about 15 percent of the total money supply as of mid-January. It is a straight, logical conclusion that a digital rupee will replace physical cash.

A digital version of fiat currency is, by definition, an online token and has no physical presence. In that, it is a perfect replacement of cash for an economy. Therefore the introduction and adoption of a CBDC is most compatible with a state that intends to bring its population under the formal economy and the tax net. This was one of the stated motivations for Nigeria in adopting the eNaira. Financial inclusion plays a big part in the introduction to the eNaira.

But if cash was so easy to replace, why are other countries not taking a headlong plunge into CBDCs of their own?

Replacement of cash invariably leads to other instruments getting booted out as well when it comes to store of value or safety. While cash is the most convenient and opaque medium of exchange, it requires a visit to the bank or an automated teller machine (ATM). A digital rupee would need neither. That’s a mixed blessing that the adoption of a CBDC would entail."
NEUTRAL;"Non-fungible tokens – NFTs – are becoming ubiquitous even as many people may still not understand what they are and how they work. Yet, there is money to be made in trading these digital tokens that represent real-world items like artwork and music.

This democratisation of the virtual world, where content creators can market their NFTs and trade them freely, is fuelling the rapid rise of NFTs as valuables today.

For entrepreneurs and artists alike, learning how to mint NFTs can be the gateway to monetising their digital content at market-beating prices."
