1;GOOD;"PARIS (Reuters) -French carmaker Renault (EPA:RENA) said on Friday that ""all options are on the table"" for separating its electric vehicle (EV) business, including a possible public listing in the second half of 2023.

Thierry Piéton, Renault's finance chief, said that any plans were subject to approval from its alliance partner Nissan (OTC:NSANY), but made clear that the Japanese carmaker ""is in the loop"" as it weighs up its options.

Renault has been pushing ahead with plans to split its EV and combustion engine businesses as it seeks to catch up with rivals such as Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Volkswagen (ETR:VOWG_p).

Ford said last month that it will run its EV business separately from its legacy combustion engine operations.

The news came as Renault posted better-than-expected revenue for the first quarter, as higher prices and rising EV sales largely offset the impact of the war in Ukraine and an ongoing global shortage of semiconductors .

Renault shares were up around 1% in early trading after its results announcement.

The group, which also produces Dacia and Lada brand vehicles, said on Friday its revenue fell by 2.7% from a year earlier to 9.748 billion euros ($10.6 billion). Analysts had expected revenue of around 9.61 billion euros, according to Refinitiv estimates.

Excluding the activities of Avtovaz and Renault Russia, revenue was down 1.1% at 8.9 billion euros.

Last month, Renault said it would suspend operations at its plant in Moscow while it assesses options on its majority stake in Avtovaz, Russia's No. 1 carmaker.

On Friday, the French carmaker said talks on the future of Russian operations were ""ongoing and making progress.""

The drop in first-quarter revenue followed a 17% decline of Renault's vehicle sales to 552,000 vehicles, the lowest quarterly sales since during the height of the global financial crisis in 2009.

The company said its sales of fully-electric and hybrid vehicles rose 13% and accounted for 36% of sales. Renault said its prices were up 5.6% from the first quarter of 2021 as the carmaker pursues more profitable car sales.

In a client note J.P. Morgan analysts described this as a ""strong quarter"" for Renault.

""Renault continues to deliver on its pricing and model rationalization policy and today’s result comes in as

another step in the right direction,"" they wrote.

Renault confirmed its financial outlook laid out in March of a full-year 2022 operating margin of around 3% and said it would give a more detailed update on its targets and strategy later this year.

The global shortage of semiconductors, used in everything from brake sensors to entertainment systems, will cut Renault's planned car production by 300,000 vehicles in 2022, mostly in the first half of the year, the company said.

Renault's order book at the end of March had hit a 15-year high of 3.9 months of sales."
2;BAD;"(Reuters) - Russia may face an ""orchestrated"" default on state debt due to Western sanctions which should not be seen as a technical default, the CEO of Russia's second-largest lender VTB Andrey Kostin said in TV interview released on Friday.

As Russia teeters on the brink of a historic default, foreign investors in the country's debt have few palatable options to recover their money: bet on costly legal action, trust bilateral agreements will stand, or sit on their hands, analysts say."
3;BAD;"European stock markets traded sharply lower Friday, with investors fretting about the likelihood of slowing economic growth on the back of aggressive monetary policy tightening as well as the impact of the war in Ukraine.

By 3:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 1.2% lower, the CAC 40 in France fell 1% and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 dropped 0.4%.

European markets have followed the negative lead from Wall Street and then Asia on the back of comments from Jerome Powell late Thursday, with the U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman saying a half-point interest rate increase will be ""on the table"" when the central bank meets in May.

This follows European Central Bank Vice President Luis de Guindos acknowledging the possibility of a rate increase in July, potentially the bank’s first in 12 years. 

Money markets are now pricing in 80 basis points of ECB rate hikes by the end of the year.

The world’s major central banks are looking to tighten monetary policy to combat soaring inflation, just as the war in Ukraine weighs on the outlook for global growth.

The World Bank estimated that the physical damage to Ukraine's buildings and infrastructure from Russia's invasion has reached roughly $60 billion to-date, while Ukraine’s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, put the total cost of rebuilding the country at $600 billion.

U.K. retail sales fell 1.4% on the month in March, dropping for the third time in the last four months, with soaring fuel costs appearing to have an increasing impact on spending patterns.

In corporate news, Kering (EPA:PRTP) stock fell over 5% after reporting slowing growth at the French luxury group’s star label Gucci, weighed by Covid lockdowns in mainland China.

Anheuser Busch Inbev (EBR:ABI) stock fell 1.9% after the world's largest brewer said it will take a hit of over $1 billion on due to exiting its joint venture in Russia.

SAP (ETR:SAPG) stock fell 4.2% after the German business software group reported a 300 million euros ($325.26 million) hit due to its exit from Russia, while Renault (EPA:RENA) stock dropped 0.8% after the French auto giant, the Western carmaker most exposed to the Russian market, posted a 2.7% drop in first quarter revenues compared with a year earlier.

Oil prices weakened Friday, on course for weekly losses of around 4%, weighed by prospects of interest rate hikes and slowing global growth, while China, the world’s largest crude importer, continued to struggle with a Covid-19 outbreak.

By 3:55 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.3% lower at $103.47 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 0.4% to $107.91. 

Additionally, gold futures rose 0.2% to $1,952.60/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.3% lower at 1.0806."
4;BAD;"Swedish truck maker AB Volvo reported a surprise rise in first-quarter core earnings on Friday, as it juggled strong market demand with a strained supply chain that has limited its capacity to keep up with orders.

The rival of Germany's Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) Truck and Traton also said it expected supplies of components to stay unstable with more disruptions and stoppages of production expected to hamper its business.

Heavy-duty truck makers have been grappling with global shortages of components, such as semiconductors, and a lack of freight capacity since market demand began to recover from the initial pandemic shock.

Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which Moscow calls a special military operation, has further clouded the outlook for supply chains and diesel fuels, and seen Western manufacturers such as Volvo cut production and sales in Russia.

Volvo's adjusted operating profit rose to 12.68 billion Swedish crowns ($1.33 billion) from 11.82 billion a year ago, well ahead of the 10.55 billion seen by analysts in a Refinitiv poll.

The results excluded a previously announced provision related to the war in Ukraine.

Shares in the Gothenburg-based company, one of Sweden's biggest employers, rose 1.1% by 0708 GMT, to leave the stock down just over 20% so far this year, mirroring broad declines for industrial blue chips.

""Despite limited visibility in the supply chain and semi-conductor shortages still impacting the industry ... we expect consensus expectations to move higher on better than expected performance of the truck division,"" equities analysts at JP Morgan wrote in a research note.

Volvo Chief Executive Martin Lundstedt said: ""We have had extra costs due to the supply chain disruptions as well as higher costs for material and have worked proactively with price management to mitigate them,""

""We expect that the inflationary pressure will continue.""

With many input costs rising rapidly, Volvo has also sought to maintain flexibility on its own pricing, leaving it loath to take on orders with delivery too far into the future.

Adding to frustrations over the supply chain problems, which forced vehicle makers to limit output in the quarter, demand for trucks has been strong across most major markets, with the result that they have been hit with both higher costs and missed sales.

""We have large order books and delivery times are long, and this has made us restrictive with order slotting, which affected order intake negatively,"" Lundstedt said in a statement.

""We are doing everything we can to reduce the long lead times to our customers.""

Hobbled by the supply constraints, Volvo said order bookings of its trucks, sold under brands such as Mack and Renault (EPA:RENA) as well as its own name, tumbled 47% year-on-year in the first quarter, while it kept unchanged forecasts for the European and North American truck markets."
5;BAD;"AB InBev (EBR:ABI) stock fell in early trading in Europe on Friday after the world's largest brewer said it will take a hit of over $1 billion on due to exiting its joint venture in Russia.

AB InBev, the company behind Budweiser, Beck's, and Hoegaarden, said it will take a non-cash charge of $1.1 billion to write down its investment in AB InBev Efes, the Russian-based JV in which it holds a 24% stake. The brewer is currently in negotiations to sell that stake to its partner, Turkey's Efes Anadolu. AB InBev has already requested the suspension of its license to brew and sell Bud in Russia, and the company said this request ""will also be part of a potential transaction,"" without elaborating further.

Russia has been a key growth market for AB InBev over the last 20 years, although beer sales growth has flattened out in recent years as the market has become more saturated. 

By 3:50 AM ET (0750 GMT), AB InBev stock was down 2.0%, underperforming a decline of 1.4% in the Euro Stoxx 50.

AB InBev's major international rivals, Heineken (OTC:HEINY) and Carlsberg (OTC:CABGY), have already announced plans to leave the country. Carlsberg said on Thursday that it currently expects a writedown of 9.5 billion Danish kroner ($1.38 billion) on its Russia business and additional writedowns of its assets in Ukraine. It revised down its earnings guidance for 2022 as a result of the war at the same time and warned of an ongoing high level of uncertainty. The stock still rose to its highest since the start of March on relief that the news wasn't worse.

Heineken said in March it expects a charge of 400 million euros ($432 million) from its exit. International sanctions on the country since its invasion of Ukraine have limited the pool of prospective buyers, and Heineken still hasn't announced who will take over its operations. The company is nonetheless paying the wage of its 1,800 staff in the country through the end of the year."
6;NEUTRAL;" Germany's industrial heavyweights are teaming up to retrain workers in areas such as software and logistics to fill a growing skills gap and avoid layoffs among workers of all ages as the economy shifts to clean energy and online shopping.

More than 36 major companies, ranging from auto suppliers such as Continental and Bosch to industrial firms BASF and Siemens, have agreed to coordinate on redundancies at one firm and vacancies at another, training workers to move directly from job to job.

Stefan Dries worked across a range of sectors before landing a job at Deutsche Post (OTC:DPSGY) in the middle of the pandemic. While social distancing had made his work as a carer impossible, the postal service was hiring to meet online delivery demands.

Dries, 38, said he completed a 10-day intensive course on everything from using software for registering and tracking post to how to lift heavy packages and has since worked his way up from deliveries to manager of his station.

""Starting something different isn't always easy financially, personally. You have to want it,"" Dries told Reuters, adding that it is vital that companies advertise positions in a way that assures workers they will be trained on the job.

The scheme underscores Germany's long-term social market economy model, which gives more influence to labour unions as opposed to free-market capitalism focused on maximizing profits.

The costs of the initiative will be shared by the companies involved on a case-by-case basis. So if a factory closes, a dialogue will begin on what to do with its workers and then involve another company which may be seeking new skills.

Continental and Deutsche Bahn, for example, have set up a partnership to retrain staff no longer needed at the auto parts maker for jobs at the railway group, with the costs split.

""We know the social cost of unemployment, and we want to avoid that,"" Ariane Reinhart, board member responsible for human resources (HR) at Continental and chief spokesperson of the business-led initiative, told Reuters.

Reinhart, who said that she believed the scheme to be the first of its kind, pointed to data showing unemployment cost the German economy 63 billion euros ($68 billion) in 2020.

While German unemployment is relatively low, at 5% in March, there are warnings of a wave of job losses if companies do not move quickly to adapt to stringent climate targets and step up in areas like software in the face of new competitors abroad.

A study by think-tank Ifo Institute warned that 100,000 jobs linked to the internal combustion engine could be lost by 2025 if carmakers failed to transition fast enough to electric vehicles and retrain workers.

'RELIABLE EMPLOYEES'

The initiative comes as the number of open vacancies in Germany is rising steadily, from around 320,000 in 2009 to 850,000 in March this year, national statistics show.

German labour market faces growing skills gap https://graphics.reuters.com/GERMANY-COMPANIES/WORKERS/akvezyqrxpr/chart.png

Engineering, metalwork and logistics are among the sectors seeking high numbers of people in Germany, alongside care work, catering and sales.

The demand for skilled workers is coming from overseas companies too, highlighted by Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s decision to build its European electric vehicle and battery plant in the state of Brandenburg, where it will create 12,000 new jobs.

This will ramp up competition for skilled workers with rival carmakers Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen (ETR:VOWG_p) who both have factories of their own only hours away.

Retraining across sectors and within companies is also a means of maintaining good relations with Germany's powerful unions, who often sit on company boards and have negotiated multi-year job guarantees for staff.

""Some of these people have no prospects any more in the combustion engine world,"" said Fevzi Sikar, head of the workers' council at Mercedes-Benz's Marienfelde plant, where assembly line production workers are being offered retraining in software engineering..

""But they are reliable employees, and it just makes more sense to retrain them ... the market is sucked dry.""

Sikar said Mercedes is seeing enthusiasm among younger workers who want to become more resilient by gaining new skills. While older workers faced with a job loss or change may opt to retire early, younger colleagues need a future elsewhere.

While the scheme can provide some of the skills that Germany needs, attracting talent from abroad is also essential, Thomas Ogilvie, board member in charge of HR at Deutsche Post, said.

Germany's new coalition government has pledged to make it easier for workers from abroad by enabling dual citizenship and improving access to apprenticeships.

""Leaving it to the free market is not enough – it would not be what's best for workers, or the economy,"" Reinhart said.

The Federal Court fined Westpac A$40 million for one of the six cases, related to charging advice fees to over 11,800 deceased customers in the latest hearing, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) said on Friday. It was the biggest fine of all the six cases.

ASIC's legal actions that were initiated in November include the lender's compliance failures across its banking, superannuation, wealth management and insurance business over many years.

Australia's financial sector has faced intense scrutiny since a Royal Commission inquiry in 2018 found widespread shortcomings across the industry, with charging the dead among the most common and damaging revelations.

""Over the course of 13 years, more than 70,000 customers have been affected by these failures, either by being incorrectly charged or given the wrong information,"" ASIC Deputy Chair Sarah Court said https://

11;NEUTRAL;"Santos Ltd played down on Friday an Alaska road access dispute with ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP), saying their feud was not slowing work on the $3 billion Pikka oil project or the Australian gas producer's efforts to sell its stake in it.

Santos rejected a proposal by ConocoPhillips to charge $95 million for long-term access to roads on the U.S. oil and gas producer's Kuparuk River Unit (KRU) oil fields, next to the Pikka project run by Oil Search (OTC:OISHY), which Santos acquired last year.

Instead, Santos applied to the Alaska Department of Natural Resources for a land use permit, which it received on March 29, pending an agreement between the two companies on the long-term access.

ConocoPhillips challenged that decision on April 5 and the department's commissioner, Corri Feige, has given Oil Search until June 7 to respond before she decides on the appeal.

""There has been no impact to access and the land permit granted to Santos by the Division of Oil and Gas on 29 March remains current,"" a Santos spokesperson said in an email.

While the company expects the Pikka project to be ready for a final investment decision by mid-year, it is also trying to sell its 51% stake in the project, as it looks to raise up to $3 billion from asset sales this year.

The Federal Court issued https://www.accc.gov.au/media-release/trivago-to-pay-447-million-in-penalties-for-misleading-consumers-over-hotel-room-rates the fine on Friday after finding Trivago, a hotel booking website, falsely presented hotel rooms as being the cheapest available, when it was in fact promoting rooms of paid advertisers.

In January 2020, the court found that Trivago had breached Australian Consumer Law by misleading consumers by using an algorithm that pushed hotels paying ""the highest cost-per-click fee"" higher, and not highlighting the cheapest rates for consumers, the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission (ACCC) said.

""The loss or damage caused by Trivago's contraventions was substantial. This arose from consumers making a booking in relation to a non-cheapest Top Position Offer when they could have booked a room at the same hotel at a cheaper price,"" Federal Court Judge Nathan Moshinsky wrote in the judgment.

ACCC Chair Gina Cass-Gottlieb said that Trivago's conduct took advantage of consumers' desire to find the best deal, and the Court's decision to order such a significant penalty reflects the seriousness of the company's conduct.

""Following the initial judgement, which offered new guidance about how results of comparator websites should display recommendations in Australia, Trivago worked quickly to change its website so as to comply with the court's decision,"" the online hotel search platform told Reuters."
13;NEUTRAL;"Honda Motor Co plans to build millions of electric vehicles (EV) by 2030 using three new dedicated platforms, with one to be jointly developed with U.S. partner General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), a top executive at the Japanese automaker said.

Shinji Aoyama, Honda's global head of electrification, told Reuters on Thursday the firm will introduce an electric mini commercial vehicle in Japan in 2024, built on a new small EV platform. This will be followed by full-size electric model in North America in 2026, on a new large platform.

Both platforms will be used for other models.

Speaking in a video call, Aoyama said a third platform, which he described as ""medium size"", will be shared with General Motors, starting in 2027.

The two companies in early April said they would jointly develop ""affordable electric vehicles"" for global markets, but released few other details.

""Whether they will be based on Honda's architecture or on GM's platform has not been decided,"" Aoyama said.

""We have not decided which plants (or) what will be produced,"" he added. ""But we are going to share the bill of process"" for manufacturing ""to enable the cars to be produced at either"" Honda or GM plants.

GM is building two premium electric SUVs for Honda in North America, starting in 2024, based on the dedicated EV platform that underpins GM's Cadillac Lyriq.

Aoyama said Honda has agreed to use GM's next-generation Ultium battery, though the specifications have not been finalized. But the Japanese automaker has no plans to participate in GM's Ultium battery joint venture with South Korea's LG Energy Solution, he said.

Honda has said it plans to build two million electric vehicles globally by 2030, including the mid-size models being developed with GM.

Aoyoma said Honda is targeting North American production of 750,000-800,000 electric vehicles in 2030, and about the same in China, with another 400,000-500,000 in Japan and other markets"
14;NEUTRAL;"Two Georgia election workers who were the target of vote-rigging conspiracy theories have reached a settlement agreement with the far-right One America News Network in their defamation lawsuit against the outlet, according to court papers filed on Thursday.

Wandrea ""Shaye"" Moss, a voter registration officer in Fulton County, and Ruby Freeman, Moss's mother and a temp worker for the 2020 election, sued OAN officials along with former U.S. President Donald Trump's ex-lawyer Rudy Giuliani for allegedly spreading lies about them in their efforts to overturn Trump's election loss.

The agreement announced on Thursday in U.S. District Court in Washington will result in Moss and Freeman's asking Chief Judge Beryl Howell to dismiss the OAN defendants from the litigation. In addition to the network itself, those defendants are OAN Chief Executive Robert Herring, President Charles Herring and reporter Chanel Rion.

Terms of the settlement were not disclosed in a joint status report filed with the court.

The settlement will leave only Giuliani as a defendant. Joseph Sibley, the lawyer representing the OAN defendants and Giuliani, did not respond to requests for comment.

The lawsuit alleges that OAN broadcast stories that falsely accused Moss and Freeman of conspiring to produce secret batches of illegal ballots and running them through voting machines to help Joe Biden, a Democrat, defeat Trump, a Republican.

There is no evidence to support the election fraud claims, which have been repeatedly debunked by Georgia election officials.

Giuliani, who spearheaded Trump's efforts to overturn Biden's election win, appeared at a hearing with Georgia lawmakers in which he showed snippets of surveillance video showing the two women at work in a ballot-processing room at State Farm Arena in Atlanta. He repeatedly identified Moss and Freeman by name, calling them ""crooks"" who ""obviously"" stole votes.

A state investigation said the full video showed that the women were properly and legally counting ballots.

Biden won a narrow victory in Georgia in 2020, helped by a strong showing in Atlanta, which is located in Fulton County.

Trump's election campaign team circulated OAN stories about the two women and Trump himself played excerpts of the video at a rally with voters.

Moss and Freeman reported being besieged by violent threats from Trump supporters after OAN and the Trump campaign began circulating the reports.

The lawsuit sought the removal of the reports about Freeman and Moss from OAN's websites and other media channels, as well as compensatory and punitive damages.

Moss and Freeman, in their joint status report, said they had a ""successful one-day mediation"" on Tuesday with the OAN defendants and had ""signed a binding set of settlement terms"" with them.

Michael Gottlieb, a lawyer for Moss and Freeman, called it ""a fair and reasonable settlement,"" in a statement."

The so-called Fidelity Stack was timed to launch at the same time as the brokerage's Fidelity Metaverse ETF, which gives investors the opportunity to invest in businesses involved in the metaverse, a network of virtual environments accessed via different devices where users can work, socialize and play.

The Fidelity Stack, which was built in Decentraland, a web platform that mimics a metropolitan area, with commerce districts, offices and event spaces, is open to all but is largely aimed at 18-35 year-olds, said David Dintenfass, chief marketing officer and head of emerging customers at Fidelity.

""We're trying to make sure we're staying current for the next generation,"" he said in an interview.

In 2021, 3.8 million new Fidelity brokerage accounts were opened up by investors aged 18 to 35 and the company has made a push to engage with those customers, including through its own Reddit sub-thread and TikTok account.

Last May, Boston-based Fidelity launched a brokerage account designed exclusively for teens, supervised by their parents, and about 60,000 of the accounts have been opened so far, Dintenfass said.

25;NEUTRAL;"Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc's eye-popping profit margin has raised doubts among Wall Street analysts if the company would be able to keep at it amid rising commodity costs and higher expenses to increase production.

The world's most valuable automaker pocketed a hefty 32.9% margin, more than double that of legacy firms including General Motors (NYSE:GM), Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and Stellantis, who too have been spending heavily for a share of the lucrative electric vehicle market.

Tesla's record margin that came on the back of higher prices is powering a nearly 9% rise in Tesla's stock price on Thursday and has led at least five analysts to raise their price target, but with a warning.

Margin could come under pressure in the coming months as the spending on rampup at the plants in Berlin and Texas gradually becomes a part of cost of production and moves out of research and development expenses, they said.

""While the margins are impressive, some fear that they might be at their peak,"" said Julie Gillespie, head of market research at TipRanks.

Rising commodity costs too could eat into margins even though Tesla's price increases are designed to offset higher anticipated costs in the next six to 12 months.

The recent price hikes are for orders that are likely to be delivered a year later in some cases and could incur higher production costs, potentially squeezing the margins.

For Tesla, this implies production rampup would play a crucial role. ""Its margins ultimately depend on how many cars rattle through the production line,"" Laura Hoy, analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown (LON:HRGV) said.

""That makes volume loss one of the biggest fundamental risks to the group's margins. While demand has remained strong in the face of higher prices, affordability will always be an important factor to consider.""

Still, many investors remain bullish on the company's prospects after Chief Executive Elon Musk hinted at the automaker being able to achieve 60% volume growth this year, up from 50% predicted in the fourth-quarter earnings call.

""I would be surprised if the margins came down because they just get better and better,"" said investor Thomas Hayes, managing member at Great Hill Capital LLC, adding there will be some costs with investing in factories but production would also grow.

The company blamed broad-based inflationary pressure and increased logistics costs from supply chain disruption for its operating loss. However, it expects to offset most of these cost increases with price actions, and additional ""Project Own It"" savings.

“Revenue was in line with expectations this quarter despite an increasingly volatile operating environment,” said Xerox Vice Chairman and CEO John Visentin.

The tobacco giant took a charge of 3 cents per share related to the war in Ukraine in the first quarter, after discontinuing sales of a number of Marlboro and Parliament cigarette products in Russia.

The company, which is working on options to exit Russia, has also canceled product launches for the year and suspended its planned investments there following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.

During the quarter the company started its production and deliveries from Gigafactory Berlin (March 2022) and Gigafactory Texas (April 2022).

The company noted that supply chain challenges have remained persistent and it has been navigating through them for over a year. Furthermore, recent COVID-19 outbreaks have been weighing on the company’s supply chain and factory operations, in addition to chip shortages.

According to the company, the inflationary impact with some raw material prices increasing multiple-fold in recent months has contributed to adjustments in the company’s product pricing, despite the ongoing focus on reducing its manufacturing costs where possible."
29;BAD;"A former eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY) security executive intends to plead guilty to federal charges that he planned a cyberstalking campaign that targeted a Massachusetts couple whose online newsletter was seen as critical of the e-commerce company.

James Baugh, eBay's former senior director of safety and security, had been awaiting trial in Boston with another ex-executive accused of helping harass the couple through Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) and with disturbing deliveries like a bloody Halloween pig mask and live cockroaches.

At the request of Baugh's lawyers, a federal judge on Tuesday scheduled a hearing for him to instead plead guilty on April 25. A May 31 trial remains scheduled for his co-defendant, David Harville, eBay's former director of global resiliency.

William Fick, a lawyer for Baugh, declined to comment.

Baugh is one of seven former eBay workers who were charged in 2020 with harassing the married couple in Natick, Massachusetts, behind the newsletter EcommerceBytes.

They did so after two top executives, including former Chief Executive Officer Devin Wenig, expressed frustration with the newsletter, according to prosecutors and a lawsuit the couple, David and Ina Steiner, filed against eBay.

Prosecutors said the Steiners in August 2019 began receiving anonymous, harassing private messages on Twitter and disturbing deliveries to their home that also included fly larvae, spiders and a funeral wreath.

Prosecutors said Baugh planned the threatening messages and deliveries with employees and contractors who reported to him and traveled with some to Massachusetts to surveil the couple.

After learning that Natick police were investigating, Baugh and others deleted messages from their social media accounts, and he lied to eBay investigators by denying that its employees were involved, prosecutors said.

Five other former eBay workers have pleaded guilty. Wenig was not charged and has denied knowing about the scheme. eBay has said it is in settlement talks with the couple."

37;NEUTRAL;"Wall Street's major banks and asset managers were cautious about the economy as they detailed how both consumers and institutional clients were struggling to deal with sky-high inflation and looming rate hikes.

The big U.S. banks are reporting results at a time of surging inflation, which is leading to predictions that the U.S. Federal Reserve will hike interest rates aggressively this year.

While that can benefit big lenders by increasing what they earn from loans, rapid rate hikes could slow the economy and scupper a nascent recovery from the pandemic.

""Higher rates are typically a positive for banks,"" said Jason Ware, chief investment officer for Albion Financial Group, which holds JPMorgan shares. ""But if borrowers are unable to absorb higher borrowing costs it is an offsetting benefit. There could be a headwind if they rise too much.""

Several banks started stockpiling cash to cushion potential loan losses if inflation bites.

While that showed some banks were getting more concerned about the macro environment, it was ""not necessarily a prognostication we will hit bad economic times,"" Ware said.

U.S. monthly consumer prices increased by the most in 16-1/2 years in March to hit 8.5% year-on-year.

Mortgage rates meanwhile have been soaring, with the average interest rate on the most popular U.S. home loan rising to more than 5% last week, the highest level since November 2018.

""All of our clients are feeling the impact of the inflationary pressures across the board,"" Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) Chief Financial Officer Mike Santomassimo told reporters on a call.

While Santomassimo said that inflation has not yet shown up as a risk for the bank's credit portfolios, the bank said that higher interest rates would hurt mortgage volumes. Mortgage loans fell 33% from a year ago on lower originations and gains from home sales.

Lower-income consumers are being the most impacted by rising energy and food prices, Wells' CEO Charles Scharf said later on a conference call.

Scharf said that while the bank would likely see an increase in credit losses from historical lows, ""we should be a net beneficiary as we will also benefit from rising rates.""

JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM)'s Chief Executive Jamie Dimon on Wednesday warned of economic uncertainties, partly arising from soaring inflation. The bank also showed weaker mortgage lending, with loans down 3%.

Albion's Ware said, however, if inflation does come down and growth does normalize, the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield, which influences mortgage rates, could settle, which would be good for mortgage rates and borrowers."
38;GOOD;"Shares of Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) are trading more than 1% higher today.

The bank reported EPS of $10.76 on net revenue of $12.93 billion, compared to analyst expectations of $11.73 billion. The annualized ROE growth came in at 15%, while analysts were projecting 12.5% growth.

Investment banking revenue totaled $2.13 billion in the quarter, missing the consensus projection of $2.28 billion. Equities sales and trading revenue came in at $3.15 billion, also above the estimates of $2.73 billion.

Trading revenue stood at $7.87 billion, well above the expected $5.84 billion.

Citi analyst Keith Horowitz said that GS managed to deliver a “very strong quarter in a tough environment.”

“We were well ahead of consensus heading into 1Q, and GS beat our number mainly on expenses while relative to consensus it was more of a top line beat.”

Evercore ISI analyst Glenn Schorr also weighed in positively.

“While investors never like to pay for great trading at Goldman and shiver at the thought of saying Goldman and consumer in the same sentence, it is what it is and a 15.8% ROTCE when capital markets are in upheaval, banking is massively disrupted and markets are off a lot should count towards Goldman executing on the plan to build a more resilient and durable revenue stream and mix of businesses,” he told clients."
39;GOOD;"Shares of Citigroup (NYSE:C) are up 1.5% today after the bank said it recorded revenue of $19.19 billion in Q1.

This is 2.4% lower YoY, though topping the expected $18 billion. The bank reported a Q1 EPS of $2.02.

Citi also reported better-than-expected FICC sales & trading revenue for Q1. The bank posted FICC sales & trading revenue of $4.3 billion, down from 1.1% in the year-ago period and above the consensus estimates of $3.98 billion.

“Net release included a $1.9 billion ACL build related to Citi’s exposures in Russia and the broader impact of the conflict in Ukraine on the macroeconomic environment,” Citi said.

Earnings also reflect the Asia Consumer divestiture-related costs of about $677 million ($588 million after-tax), Citi said.

“Current macro backdrop impacted investment banking as we saw a contraction in capital market activity. This remains a key area of investment for us,” said Citi CEO Jane Fraser.

“We continue to see the health and resilience of the U.S. Consumer through our cost of credit and their payment rates.”

“While geopolitics dampened performance in Wealth Management, we are hiring bankers, enhancing our client offerings and continuing to add clients in both the Private Bank and Citigold,” she added."

41;BAD;"Volkswagen (ETR:VOWG_p) stock fell in morning trading in Europe on Thursday after the world's second-biggest carmaker said deliveries slumped 31% in March due to Russia's war in Ukraine and ongoing problems in its supply chain.

It also warned of a potential financial hit from volatility in ""unpredictable"" commodity markets, saying that developments there could have ""significant impacts on the valuation of hedging operations.""

The warning comes a day after JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) admitted it had lost $120 million due to the price spike in nickel on the London Metals Exchange. Prices for other battery metals and copper have also been volatile so far this year. However, VW didn't give any further details of its exposures. 

Volkswagen preferred stock fell 1.6% on the news, making it one of the worst performers in the benchmark DAX index on the day. 

At a group level, deliveries were down 31% on the year in March at 655,800. 

The idling of its plant in Kaluga, Russia, and the interruption of supplies of wire harnesses from facilities in Ukraine due to the war led to deliveries falling 43% in eastern Europe and 24% in western Europe, its biggest market. Sales were hurt most at its mass-market brand, as the company prioritized its higher-margin Porsche and Audi businesses for scarce inputs. 

However, its operations in China also appeared to be heavily disrupted, against a backdrop of spreading lockdowns of industrial and logistics facilities to stop the Covid-19 virus. Sales in China fell 37% to 217,800 and appear under threat for the foreseeable future, after President Xi Jinping on Wednesday reaffirmed the country's commitment to its aggressive ""Dynamic Clearing"" policy for fighting the coronavirus. Nomura analysts estimate that nearly 400 million people in China are currently under restrictions on mobility due to Covid-19.

The alarming development in deliveries overshadowed more positive news showing that the company made an operating profit of some 8.5 billion euros in the first quarter, and an operating margin of around 13.5%."
42;GOOD;"Sales at Birkin bag maker Hermes beat estimates in the first quarter, lifted by strong appetite for its luxury accessories, particularly in the United States and Europe, as the sector powers through turbulence from the war in Ukraine and COVID lockdowns in China.

Hermes, which also sells silk scarves and porcelain tableware, had a strong start of the year in China until the beginning of March, when restrictions aimed at stemming the spread of the coronavirus prompted some store closures, including three in Shanghai, Executive Vice President for Finance Eric du Halgouet told journalists in a call.

“We are confident and hope that these stores in Shanghai will reopen quickly – in any case the fundamentals are excellent in China,"" he said.

The French luxury group said revenues at constant exchange rates came rose 27% to 2.8 billion euros ($3.06 billion) in the three months to March, ahead of a consensus forecast of 15%organic growth.

The results confirm ""the year is off with a bang,"" said Luca Solca, analyst with Bernstein.

Hermes shares rose as much as 4.5% and traded up 1.3% at 0900 GMT.

All divisions clocked double-digit growth, including the leather goods and saddlery activity known for its Birkin and Kelly handbags, which accounts for nearly half of annual sales and reported 15.8% sales growth.

Other divisions grew even more, with ready-to-wear and accessories division up 44% and sales of watches up 62%.

Hermes is in close contact with its 60 employees in Russia, continuing to pay their salaries while providing training and psychological support, du Halgouet said. Some have relocated to countries nearby.

The group last month said it was suspending commercial operations in Russia, closing its three stores in Moscow and putting plans to open one in St. Petersburg on hold. All exports to the country have been halted and Hermes is complying with rules banning sales to sanctioned oligarchs, the executive added.

Production of leather goods, which is based in France, has normalized after COVID-related disruptions at the start of the year, and production of other goods, including porcelain and silk has also increased since January, the finance chief said.

At the end of last year, Hermes missed market forecasts - a rare instance of underperforming rivals - as self-imposed production caps kept the group from meeting demand for its prized handbags.

Hermes limits volume growth in its leather goods production to 6% to 7% annually, preferring to have long waiting lists for its products rather than speed up production."

That caution was reflected in $902 million of net new provisions against possible loan losses, ending a sequence of quarters that has been hallmarked by the release of previous provisions as the pandemic has receded.

77;NEUTRAL;" Trading may be a surprise bright spot for Wall Street banks in the first quarter, after clients rejigged portfolios in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine and interest rate hikes, analysts and executives say.

But quarterly results from banks including Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) will show a sharp decline in investment banking revenues and in first-quarter earnings overall. That is due to companies pausing deals until choppy equity markets stabilize.

Coming into the year, banks had expected trading volumes to decline to levels similar to 2019, following exceptional activity in 2020 and 2021. Traders had benefited from the Federal Reserve pumping liquidity into markets to mitigate the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

But the conflict in Ukraine, which Russia calls a ""special military operation,"" and the prospect of multiple interest rate hikes as the Fed attempts to bring inflation under control, has led to traders enjoying another bumper period.

""There's definitely been more volatility than we expected coming into the year and that volatility benefited trading businesses, particularly on the fixed income side,"" said one senior New York-based banker.

Uncertainty over the pace of interest rate hikes by central banks has stimulated rates trading, the source said.

Another senior executive at a European bank with large U.S. operations said his firm's trading businesses had enjoyed a ""pretty phenomenal quarter.""

""It was a very similar trend to what we saw in the same quarter last year in terms of volumes,"" he said.

Banks face exceptionally tough comparatives. The first quarter last year saw major equity indexes hit record highs, driving volumes. Having initially forecast sharp year-on-year declines, analysts now expect a similar performance this year.

Analysts at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) anticipate a boost in banks' trading revenues ""that could roughly mirror the exceptional results of first-quarter 2021,"" they said in a research note.

Still, some see more headwinds. Christopher McGratty of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods estimates an 18% decline in trading revenues."

""We have expanded warehousing so that we can - if necessary - bridge the time until we can use other sources of supply,"" Faury told the newspaper as he warned against imposing an embargo on titanium in the first place.

""It would hardly harm Russia because (titanium) only accounts for a small part of export earnings there. But it would massively damage the entire European aviation industry,"" the CEO told FAS.

This kind of uncertainty can make traders a lot of money, he said.

""The Volvo Group has total assets of about 9 billion crowns related to Russia, of which about 6 billion crowns is cash items that could be materialized over the coming years,"" it said in a statement.

""In the first quarter 2022, assets amounting to approximately 4 billion crowns will be provided for and have a negative impact on operating income, primarily in the Financial Services segment,"" it added.

Volvo in February suspended all sales, service and production in Russia, which last year accounted for about 3% of its net group sales of about 372.2 billion crowns.

The company's production site in Kaluga, near Moscow, has a capacity to produce 15,000 vehicles per year and employed over 600 people.

At the same time, U.S. equity funds received $20 billion, and Asian equity funds obtained $8.7 billion in March, the data showed.

The divergence in flows highlights investors' reluctance to be exposed to markets deemed vulnerable to the ongoing conflict and on account of Europe's higher trade links with Russia and Ukraine.

Analysts expect higher inflation levels will raise companies' input costs and squeeze their profit margins.

Euro zone inflation surged to a record 7.5% in March, as the war in Ukraine and sanctions on Russia pushed fuel and natural gas prices to record highs.

""The growth outlook is slowing,"" Sarah McCarthy, analyst at Bernstein, said in a note.

""It is easy to raise prices to counteract increases in input costs when the economy is roaring, less easy in a slowdown.""

The data showed Zwitserleven Duurzaam Index Aandelenfonds Europa had outflows worth $912 million, while BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) European Dynamic A Acc and iShares MSCI Eurozone ETF faced outflows worth $503 million and $468 million respectively last month.

Last month, Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) lowered its earnings per share growth forecast for Europe to 3% in 2022 from its earlier forecast of 10%.

Wells Fargo analyst Ike Boruchow cut the rating for Ralph Lauren to equal weight from overweight, lowering the price target to $110 from $135.

According to StreetInsider, the analyst believes that too much “good” news is priced into the shares, making them “susceptible to significant derating”.

The U.S. Department of Commerce is investigating alleged circumvention of antidumping and countervailing duties by solar manufacturers in Asia. While one would expect any punitive measure by the Department to be a tailwind for the company, the analyst believes the policy has consistently failed to drive pricing power.

“We highlight still rising aluminum costs, and pass through on elevated bunkers as yet to materialize on freight in particular,” the analyst wrote in a client note.

The company last month disappointed with its fourth-quarter numbers.

October-December net sales rose 50% to $0.9 billion but were still short of estimates. Full-year sales were $2.9 billion, and the company is now projecting that to fall to at least $2.6 billion in the current year. Sales could be even lower at $2.4 billion, according to the company’s guidance.

The company closed December with a contracted backlog of 26.2 GW.

The company issued a wide range for its 2022 projected operating income, implying a significant fall to $55 million-$155 million in 2022 from $587 million. The company blamed this on production start-up expenses and underutilization of losses related to factory upgrades."

In a baseline scenario where governments largely shy away from major new climate change policies - known as 'RCP 4.5' by scientists - lower- and lower-middle income countries are likely to see 3.6 times greater gross domestic product losses on average than richer ones.

Bangladesh, India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka's exposure to wildfires, floods, major storms and also water shortages mean South Asia has 10%-18% of GDP at risk, roughly treble that of North America and 10 times more than the least-affected region, Europe.

Central Asia, the Middle East and North Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa regions all face sizable losses too. East Asia and Pacific countries face similar levels of exposure as Sub-Saharan Africa, but mainly because of storms and floods rather than heat waves and drought."

116;BAD;"Caterpillar Inc (NYSE:CAT) warned that demand in China will be even weaker than the mining and construction giant previously expected as Covid-19 lockdowns across the nation threatens to undermine economic growth.

The company’s first-quarter results Thursday showed China sales and demand slumping, even as other businesses including mining and construction improved. Caterpillar had seen “strong years” in 2020 and 2021 for China and had expected this year to return more back to 2019 levels, Chief Financial Officer Andrew Bonfield said in an interview.

“Now our expectations are slightly lower than that,” Bonfield said. “Overall the good news for us is demand is so strong elsewhere that any impact that China enables us to actually supply other customers around the world, and we didn’t miss a beat in the quarter despite the relative weakness of China.”

Shares were down 1.4% as of 7:38 a.m. in New York during premarket trading. Caterpillar’s results signal the threat of an economic slowdown in China, whose markets are tumbling as the nation looked increasingly left to its own devices in a bid to rescue its economy from the Covid crisis. "
117;NEUTRAL;"Danish brewer Carlsberg (OTC:CABGY) said on Thursday rising consumer prices had not dented demand for beer, as it geared up for further price increases in some markets later this year to make up for soaring commodity costs.

The message from Carlsberg echoes that of other large European companies like Nestle and Danone saying they had successfully managed to pass on higher costs to consumers without harming sales.

The world's third-biggest brewer said sales rose 27% in the first quarter, with the strongest growth in Western Europe despite economic uncertainty from rising inflation.

""We've learned from previous crises that when consumers can't afford to go on holiday or spend money on new cars and fridges, they instead focus on more affordable luxury items such as premium beer,"" Chief Executive Cees't Hart said.

""So far we've seen very little evidence of any consumer impact from higher beer prices,"" he said.

The rise in sales in the first quarter was in part due to a deflated comparison last year when coronavirus lockdowns closed many restaurants and bars.

Carlsberg, the Western brewer most exposed to the Russian market, joined rivals Anheuser-Busch InBev and Heineken (OTC:HEINY) in seeking to withdraw from Russia after Moscow invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24.

The brewer had seen interest in its Russian business, but it was difficult to say what price it could achieve, Hart said.

""We're making good progress, but it may take quite a while,"" he said, without naming potential buyers.

Carlsberg last week said it expected the sale to result in a writedown of about 9.5 billion Danish crowns.

""(Our calculations) brought us to a certain valuation in the market. The question of course is whether we can get that valuation. That is difficult to assess,"" Hart said.

The company holds a 27% share of the Russian market through its ownership of the country's biggest brewer Baltika.

Carlsberg last year generated 10% of its total revenue and 6% of its operating profit in Russia, where it has eight breweries and 8,400 employees.

Hart also said it had reopened its Ukrainian breweries in Kyiv and Lviv, although they were not running at full capacity.

The breweries were closed following what the Kremlin calls its ""special military operation"" to demilitarise Ukraine.

Carlsberg's sales in the January to March period totalled 14.9 billion Danish crowns ($2.10 billion), excluding its Russia business.

The company's shares have recovered slightly since it announced it would exit the Russian market, but remain down around 10% since the start of the invasion. They were trading 1.3% higher at 1022 GMT.

Carlsberg left its full-year guidance for operating profit unchanged with a forecast at between minus 5% and plus 2%."

The carrier on Thursday posted an operating loss of 173.1 billion yen ($1.3 billion), but expects to swing to a 50 billion yen profit in the year that began April 1.

Japan's largest airline said a sustained focus on reducing operating expenses along with increased domestic travel, strong cargo sales and favorable conditions for growth of international traffic point all point to a better year.

Japan in late March lifted all domestic pandemic restrictions. That has cleared the way for a forecast recovery in domestic flight demand to 80% of pre-pandemic levels on average this financial year, ANA Chief Executive Koji Shibata told reporters.

The number of passengers who booked flights for next week's string of public holidays known as ""Golden Week"" is expected to roughly double from a year ago, he added.

Annual revenue surged 40% to 1.02 trillion yen, driven in part by a record cargo performance and is forecast to jump another 63% this financial year.

Although the move to 5G and fiber optic-powered broadband internet has come at a huge cost for U.S. telecom players, hunger for data in a connected world is expected to drive a big rise in subscriber numbers in the coming years.

Last week, Verizon (NYSE:VZ) reported a smaller-than-expected subscriber loss, while AT&T (NYSE:T) saw a surge in customer additions as more people opted for 5G.

T-Mobile added 589,000 postpaid phone customers, compared with estimates of 584,900 according to FactSet, while it added three times more customers than last year for its high-speed internet services.

Postpaid phone customers pay for service at the end of each billing cycle and are considered valuable and less likely to switch carriers.

After a sell-off erased more than $600 billion from the city’s equities, attractive valuations stood as a potential bright spot. But those multiples don’t look so good when analysts keep slashing their profit forecasts for 2019. Their call for an average 19% slump in operating income would be the biggest contraction for Hang Seng Index companies since the global financial crisis, data compiled by Bloomberg show.

While a protracted U.S.-China trade war and a weak yuan are to blame for a big chunk of the profit reductions, the latest cuts reveal a deeper issue. With Hong Kong’s slowing economy buckling under the pressure of 11 straight weeks of protests, demand for everything from bank loans to utility gas may be jeopardized.
